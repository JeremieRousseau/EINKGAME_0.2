#EINKGAME 

##WORK IN PROGRESS 15-04-2016
##*By Rousseau Jeremie (France).*

 This is an **2D Game Engine** in construction as an pacman,
 you can move your pacman and create a wall when you click on a case,
 actually there are 20 rows and 20columns,
 script wrotten with **Html 5**, **CSS3**, **PHP 5**, **Mysql**, and **Pure Javascript**,
 I don't want to use framework to the moment.

 At the beginning it was to create an EinkGame in two bit of color black and white for an **Kindle**.
